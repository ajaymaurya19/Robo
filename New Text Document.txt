I slept.
Calm down.
I'll walk.
Who is he?
Who knows?
She smiled.
Talk to me!
Who is she?
Go to sleep.
It may rain.
She bit him.
She hit him.
She is kind.
She is eight.
Where are we?
Keep in touch!
See you again.
Give it to her.
I ate too much.
I'll see to it.
It's up to you.
Leave it to me.
Listen to this!
That's the way.
Come and see me.
Don't lie to me.
He began to run.
He just arrived.
He likes to run.
How is your dad?
I want to sleep.
I'm able to run.
Raise your hand.
What did he say?
When can we eat?
Come and help us.
He is still here.
I have to go now.
I know that much.
I made a mistake.
I walk to school.
That's our house.
Those are my CDs.
Walk ahead of me.
We'll follow you.
Beware of the dog!
He came back soon.
He has three sons.
I know how to ski.
I know what to do.
I'm kind of happy.
Keep to the right.
She began to sing.
She decided to go.
Do I have to study?
He is sure to come.
I had to walk home.
I have to dress up.
I told him to come.
I'm short of money.
May I speak to you?
She gave it to him.
She is kind to him.
She sat next to me.
Shut up and listen!
Tell me what to do.
Tom runs very fast.
We ran out of food.
We started to walk.
When does it begin?
Are you ready to go?
Do you have any gum?
Does she play piano?
Don't listen to her.
Go and wake Mary up.
He seems to know us.
I am engaged to her.
I have to leave now.
I want to go abroad.
I'm glad to see you.
I'm proud of my son.
I'm taller than you.
I'm trying to sleep.
It's free of charge.
It's time to get up.
Nobody speaks to me.
Roll the ball to me.
She boiled the eggs.
She danced with him.
She gave him a book.
She has 2,000 books.
This apple is sweet.
We swam in the lake.
Come home before six.
Go and see who it is.
I am afraid of bears.
I expect him to come.
It's a piece of cake.
The boy began to cry.
You keep out of this.
All of us were silent.
Be kind to old people.
Beware of pickpockets.
Don't drink and drive.
He can read and write.
He got a lot of money.
He has a lot of money.
He is afraid of death.
He let go of the rope.
I am tired of my work.
I got out of the taxi.
None of your business.
They made fun of Mary.
Tom and I are friends.
When is your birthday?
All of them went there.
Can you ride a bicycle?
Do you want to be rich?
He is afraid of snakes.
He is fond of swimming.
He went in place of me.
He's afraid of the sea.
I'll leave that to you.
It seems she hates you.
She got engaged to him.
She got married to him.
She stood close to him.
They're about to leave.
This CD belongs to her.
We ran after the thief.
What do you plan to do?
A square has four sides.
Charge it to my account.
Did they write a letter?
He asked us to help him.
He is known to everyone.
He objected to our plan.
I just want you to come.
I want something to eat.
Is he a friend of yours?
The news quickly spread.
I can't find it anywhere.
I thought you'd be angry.
Please sit here and wait.
She went out of the room.
Speak slowly and clearly.
The sky is full of stars.
Come and see me right now.
Do you have a lot of pens?
Go and sit by your father.
He bought a pair of shoes.
I live on the bottom floor.
I sat between Tom and John.
She wore a beautiful dress.
When did you come to Japan?
Most people think I'm crazy.
I suppose Tom is still alive.
She asked him for some money.
Tom told me about it himself.
Do you know when he will come?
He painted a picture of a dog.
I arrived ahead of the others.
I know every inch of the town.
I'm not sharing this with Tom.
She is not afraid of anything.
The price of eggs is going up.
What is the price of this cap?
Which of them is your brother?
He arrived after the bell rang.
He was not aware of the danger.
My throat hurts when I swallow.
The school looks like a prison.
I'm not sure how to answer this.
There's no easy way out of here.
Three vicious dogs attacked Tom.
Tom was in Australia a year ago.
When did the wedding take place?
Where do you keep your passport?
Because he's sick, he can't come.
Friendship requires mutual trust.
He put the ring on Mary's finger.
She glanced through the magazine.
Tom has been crying all afternoon.
Tom has been in contact with Mary.
I want to be a pilot in the future.
If Tom ran away, where could he go?
I had my pocket picked on the train.
He told her something and she smiled.
I don't like to go out when it's dark.
When he spoke, everyone became silent.
Tom drank with us until after midnight.
She has never been in a car driven by him.
Tom goes to church with Mary every Sunday.
I don't think people use that word anymore.
My younger sister got married in her teens.
I wonder why Tom suggested we do that together.
Tom says he doesn't think he can do that by himself.
People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
It's been a long time since I've heard anyone use that word.
If you want your workers to be happy, you need to pay them a decent wage.
It's my fault that the cake was burned. I was talking on the phone and didn't notice the time.
Help!
Jump.
Jump.

Birds fly.
Excuse me.
Fantastic!
I fear so.
I laughed.
I'm bored.
I'm broke.
I'm tired.
It's cold.
Who knows?

Wonderful!
Birds sing.
Come on in.

Fire burns.

Let me out!
Once again.
Please sit.
What's new?
What's new?
Who's that?
Don't shout.
Don't shout.
He stood up.
He's strong.
How are you?
How are you?
How are you?
How are you?
How are you?
How are you?
How are you?
I am hungry.
I like both.
I like cake.
I like dogs.
I like math.
I'll attend.
Nobody came.
Was I wrong?
What's this?
Are you sick?
Bring him in.
Come with us.
Happy Easter!
Has Tom left?
He is French.
I am at home.
I can't move.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I have a car.
I have a dog.
I understand.
I'm a doctor.
I'm starving!
It is a book.
It's snowing.
It's too big.
Please leave.
Unbelievable!
We are happy.
What is this?
Are you tired?
Can you drive?
Don't get fat.
Don't give in.
Drink it down.
Everyone dies.
Flowers bloom.
I am who I am.
I'll take him.
I'm tired now.
I'm very busy.
Is that a cat?
It's for free.
It's for free.
Let me try it.
Let me try it.
Let me try it.
Make it quick.
May I come in?
Open the door.
Open the door.
Please get in.
Read it again.
Read it aloud.
She bent down.
Some fish fly.
This is a map.
Tom is my son.
We're in town.
Were you shot?
What about us?
Can I help you?
Can I help you?
Clean the room.
Don't touch it.
Get out of bed!
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year!
Happy birthday!
He has a beard.
He is an actor.
He needs money.
He was hard up.
I like history.
I like the dog.
I must buy one.
I'll come back.
I'll phone you.
I'll stay home.
I'm an atheist.
I'm an atheist.
I'm very tired.
It's hot today.
It's this book.
It's your move.
Only God knows.
Summer is over.
Take your time.
Think about it.
This is a book.
This is a book.
This is my bag.
This is my dog.
Wash your feet.
We study music.
We'll call you.
We'll call you.
Where were you?
Where were you?
You have to go.
You look tired.
You're kidding!
A man must work.
Are you at home?
Are you guys OK?
Come home early.
Come if you can.
Congratulations!
Congratulations!
Did he go there?
Did you miss me?
Don't be absurd.
He came running.
He can't be ill.
He has a hat on.
He reads Arabic.
He's my husband.
How is everyone?
How is it going?
How old are you?
How rude of you!
How rude of you!
I cooked dinner.
I feel nauseous.
I go every year.
I heard a noise.
I like this one.
I run every day.
I saw her again.
I want a guitar.
I was assaulted.
I'm a good cook.
I'm a good cook.
I'm lucky today.
Is anybody here?
Is it not black?
Is there a cafe?
Let's fly kites.
No, I didn't go.
Nobody's around.
Now stop crying.
Open your mouth!
Please sit down.
She is a beauty.
She talks a lot.
She talks a lot.
That isn't fair.
That's my fault.
The dog is mine.
The power's out.
These are birds.
This is for you.
We lack nothing.
We study Arabic.
What time is it?
What time is it?
Where's my book?
You startled me!
You're a person.
Are you a doctor?
Can you teach me?
Climb to the top.
Come and join us.
Come sit with us.
Cut the potatoes.
Do you have rice?
Don't make faces.
Don't make noise.
Have a good time.
Have a nice time.
He has long legs.
He is her friend.
He likes oranges.
He likes oranges.
He must love you.
He speaks Arabic.
Here is your bag.
I can't remember.
I don't know him.
I have a problem.
I have to go now.
I live near here.
I love my mother.
I must leave now.
I'm really tired.
I'm very thirsty.
It's April first.
It's now my turn.
Let me try again.
Nice to meet you.
Please follow me.
Please sign here.
She betrayed you.
Sit down, please.
The car is ready.
This is your dog.
This is your key.
This isn't right.
Tom is my friend.
We're going home.
We're in a hurry.
Welcome to Japan.
What is your age?
What's that bird?
What's the story?
What's your name?
Where did you go?
Where is the bar?
Whose turn is it?
You may be right.
Are your eyes bad?
Birds build nests.
Birds build nests.
Boys will be boys.
Can I do anything?
Didn't you go out?
Didn't you go out?
Didn't you go out?
Do you believe me?
Do you believe me?
Do you believe me?
Don't deceive him.
He began to shout.
He came to see me.
He employs a maid.
He is after a job.
He is walking now.
He studied abroad.
He turned traitor.
He's already left.
I can drive a car.
I cried all night.
I got very sleepy.
I have a headache.
I have a headache.
I have some money.
I haven't met him.
I listen to music.
I saw him running.
I saw him running.
I truly loved her.
I work for a bank.
I'm getting happy.
I'm not a student.
I'm not like that.
I'm really hungry.
It's not my fault.
It's starting now.
My bag was stolen.
My eyes are tired.
No one's in sight.
Put your hands up!
She began to sing.
She has blue eyes.
She isn't married.
Tell me the truth.
The earth rotates.
Try it once again.
Try it once again.
Turn on the radio.
We don't know her.
We don't know him.
We have good news.
What is happiness?
What is happiness?
What is your name?
What's the matter?
Where do you live?
Where do you live?
Where do you live?

Where do you live?
Where is the book?
Where's the beach?
Who made this pie?
Yes. That's right.
You have to leave.
Are you busy today?
Are you busy today?
Can we have a talk?
Come along with us.
Did you sleep well?
Do you remember me?
Don't give up hope.
Don't throw stones.
Everyone likes her.
Everyone likes him.
Have you gone nuts?
He breathed deeply.
He closed his eyes.
He cried and cried.
He is a simple man.
He is sure to come.
He isn't my cousin.
He isn't my cousin.
He waited his turn.
He works at a bank.
He's a good person.
I admit my mistake.
I can read English.
I can read English.
I can't believe it!
I heard him go out.
I know her address.
I know his address.
I know those women.
I know your father.
I sort of like him.
I still don't know.
I was born in 1960.
I was born in 1979.
I watch television.
I worked all night.
I worked all night.
I'll see you later.
I'll see you later.
I'm as tall as you.
I'm coming at once.
Is this book yours?
It is already dark.
It looks like snow.
It started to snow.
It was sort of fun.
It's mine, not his.
It's mine, not his.
It's too expensive!
It's too expensive!
It's very hot here.
Let me handle this.
Let's take a train.
My car is a Toyota.
My family is small.
My wife is Chinese.
My wife is Chinese.
No one can help me.
She is very pretty.
She leaped for joy.
She smiled happily.
She's not a doctor.
That guy annoys me.
The batter was out.
The crow flew away.
The power went out.
These dogs are big.
This is Mary's dog.
Was his story true?
We are against war.
We are against war.
We enjoyed skating.
We were in a hurry.
We were very tired.
We're good friends.
What a big pumpkin!
What's the problem?
When does it begin?
Where are the kids?
Where is the beach?
Which dog is yours?
Who broke the vase?
Who made this cake?
Who's at the wheel?
Whose book is this?
You may use my pen.
Answer my questions.
Are they in the gym?
Can you drive a car?
Can you drive a car?
Could you sign here?
Everybody likes her.
Everybody likes him.
Excuse me, I'm lost.
He called me a taxi.
He felt very lonely.
He lives next to me.
He looks very tired.
He seems to be rich.
He'll get well soon.
He's in a bad state.
How about the taste?
How did you make it?
I am not from India.
I am reading a book.
I bought an old car.
I can teach English.
I continued singing.
I do not understand.
I don't like summer.
I forgot to ask him.
I hate taking risks.
I haven't eaten yet.
I know both of them.
I know what that is.
I tried to tell you.
I want to marry her.
I wanted her to win.
I'd like a city map.
I'd like to see her.
I'd like to see her.
I'll be back at ten.
I'll bring the wine.
I'll bring the wine.
I'll make you happy.
I've already called.
I've lost my ticket.
Let's play baseball!
Must I write in ink?
My family loved Tom.
My money was stolen.
My sister has a job.
She kept on working.
She pulled my shirt.
That is not a tiger.
That was my mistake.
The skies are clear.
The trees are green.
These are our books.
This is what I need.
Watch your language.
We are good friends.
We must pay the tax.
What did you answer?
What is in this box?
What were you doing?
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Where's the airport?
Which book is yours?
Who is your teacher?
Why didn't you come?
Will you go with us?
Winter is coming on.
You are at it again.
You may rely on him.
You must forgive me.
You must forgive me.
You must study hard.
You're a life saver.
Didn't I tell you so?
Do you have a pencil?
Do you live in Tokyo?
Do you speak English?
Don't open your book.
Don't worry about me.
Don't worry about us.
Fish live in the sea.
Go tell him yourself.
Have you been abroad?
He envied my success.
He got angry with me.
He has been to India.
He is angry with you.
He is hard to please.
He is in poor health.
He lent me two books.
He made up an excuse.
He married for money.
He saw a pretty girl.
He wanted to succeed.
How's your job going?
I agree to this plan.
I am a stranger here.
I am counting on you.
I am eating an apple.
I am eating an apple.
I don't mind waiting.
I expect him to come.
I feel like vomiting.
I have a few friends.
I have a stomachache.
I have back problems.
I have been to Kyoto.
I have caught a cold.
I just cut my finger.
I know why he did it.
I live in a big city.
I lost consciousness.
I lost consciousness.
I meant it as a joke.
I meant it as a joke.
I met Mary yesterday.
I think you're right.
I want my money back.
I will come with you.
I'll admit I'm wrong.
I'll never come back.
I'm allergic to fish.
I've lost my glasses.
I've lost my glasses.
I've made a decision.
Is he reading a book?
Is it open on Sunday?
Is the phone ringing?
It is already eleven.
It is free of charge.
It's an easy victory.
Let me take you home.
Lincoln died in 1865.
Please do it quickly.
Please shut the door.
She gave him a watch.
She wore a red dress.
She wore a red dress.
That's his specialty.
The house is haunted.
The house was ablaze.
The man looked at me.
The sheets feel damp.
The water pipe burst.
These books are mine.
These shoes are hers.
They went to the zoo.
This feels like silk.
This watch is broken.
Time goes by quickly.
Wash your hands well.
What day is it today?
What did Galileo see?
What did Galileo see?
What does it contain?
When did you see her?
When will you return?
Where is the problem?
Where is the problem?
Where is your father?
Will you go by train?
You can't prove that.
You look happy today.
Your dog is very big.
Your dog is very fat.
Can I use your pencil?
Can the rumor be true?
Can you keep a secret?
Did you see my camera?
Do you believe in God?
Do you know your size?
Do you like this book?
Does he speak English?
Don't be disappointed.
Fat hens lay few eggs.
Has the bell rung yet?
He accepted our offer.
He became a policeman.

He sang while working.
He was my dear friend.
He was sick last week.
He won the race again.
He writes beautifully.
How do you feel today?
I am grateful to them.
I am poor at swimming.
I am tired of my work.
I can't let you leave.
I dove into the river.
I have made him angry.
I live in Boston, too.
I made him my servant.
I never liked biology.
I ran away in a hurry.
I want to visit Korea.
I'm too tired to walk.
I've made my decision.
Is Mary your daughter?
Is your watch correct?
It will snow tomorrow.
Let's start the party.
Make yourself at home.
May comes after April.
My car is not running.
My eye has swollen up.
Not all birds can fly.
Please close the door.
Please leave me alone.
Please throw the ball.
Put it where you like.
Put it where you like.
Put it where you like.
She always works hard.
She asked me for help.
She got me a tiny toy.
She hated her husband.
She is five years old.
She lived a long life.
She's a stubborn girl.
Sit wherever you like.
Tell me what happened.
The lake is deep here.
The man lost all hope.
The station is nearby.
They hated each other.
They made fun of Mary.
They missed the train.
They shouted for help.
They shouted for help.
This is an apple, too.
Tom and I are friends.
We accepted his offer.
We are disturbing him.
We rested for a while.
Well, I must be going.
What is this nonsense?
What're you two doing?
What're you two doing?
Where is the elevator?
Whose books are these?
Will he come tomorrow?
Will he come tomorrow?
You didn't understand.
You reap what you sow.
You reap what you sow.
You reap what you sow.
You reap what you sow.
You reap what you sow.
Your hair is too long.
Who is it? "It's me."
A fox is a wild animal.
A rabbit has long ears.
Can anyone believe you?
Did you read it at all?
Do you like this color?
Don't ask me for money.
Don't lose your temper.
Don't make fun of them.
Don't make me slap you.
Don't say such a thing.
Don't start doing that.
Everyone knew the song.
Fish live in the water.
He can't run very fast.
He earns a good salary.
He has three daughters.
He knocked at the door.
He learned how to swim.
He robbed me of my bag.
He told me where to go.
He tore the book apart.
He understands physics.
He will soon come back.
He will soon come back.
He will soon come back.
Her father is Japanese.
I asked him to do that.
I don't agree with you.
I don't believe in God.
I don't want your pity.
I found the cage empty.
I go to school on foot.
I made the woman angry.
I prefer coffee to tea.
I seem to have a fever.
I still don't know yet.
I wake up at 7 o'clock.
I want to do it myself.
I wasn't fired. I quit.
I will be back by nine.
I wonder what happened.
I'd like a Bloody Mary.
I'll make a phone call.
I'm at the airport now.
I'm longing to see him.
I'm thinking about you.
Is anyone absent today?
Is anyone absent today?
It is difficult for me.
It's rather cold today.
Mind your own business!
My father is very nice.
My father is very nice.
My stomach is growling.
New York is a big city.
School begins in April.
School is over at 3:30.
Shall I clean the room?
She always wears black.
She can play the piano.
She has a gentle heart.
She is a wealthy woman.
She is poor, but happy.
She married a rich man.
She prattles on and on.
She showed me her room.
Should I clean my room?
That is almost correct.
That was cooked in oil.
That was cooked in oil.
That's a good question.
That's weird, isn't it?
The baby ceased crying.
The baby ceased crying.
The gate was left open.
The girl looked around.
The knife is not sharp.
The light doesn't work.
The sooner, the better.
They will be very glad.
This book is very thin.
This lion is very tame.
This silk feels smooth.
Tom started the engine.
We often make mistakes.
Were you told to do so?
What do you like to do?
What do you like to do?
What time does it open?
What's the temperature?
Who do you think he is?
Why are you stuttering?
Will we arrive in time?
You had plenty of time.
You have a good memory.
You've got to stop Tom.
Are there enough chairs?
Are you free on Tuesday?
Can I see your passport?
Can you lend me 500 yen?
Can't you speak English?
Do you watch television?
Does milk spoil quickly?
Don't drink any alcohol.
Don't forget the ticket.
Glass is made from sand.
He abandoned his family.
He betrayed his country.
He catches colds easily.
He couldn't get the job.
He decided to go abroad.
He did not get up early.
He got lost in the park.
He is smelling the soup.
He is used to hard work.
He likes playing soccer.
He looked up at the sky.
He tends to be arrogant.
He tends to be arrogant.
He tends to be arrogant.
He was accused of theft.
He was more than a king.
Her story can't be true.
I do not have much time.
I don't have much money.
I feel like throwing up.
I fell in love with her.
I found the glass empty.
I have little money now.
I have no money with me.
I have to see a dentist.
I like my job very much.
I like studying English.
I really like city life.
I wish I could help you.
I'd rather not meet him.
I'd rather not meet him.
I'll give you a present.
I've quit drinking beer.
Is this what you wanted?
It is almost 12 o'clock.
It's almost six o'clock.
It's no concern of mine.
My sister has long legs.
Shall I get you a chair?
She bought a dozen eggs.
She doesn't speak to me.
She is dressed in white.
She was late once again.
Show me another example.
Swimming is easy for me.
Take whichever you want.
That applies to him too.
That man has many debts.
